# Arduino_code

The code for the arduino is designed and implemented to test open hardware:
The feature are as follows:
1) Able to tun on or off the LED(Light Emitting Diode)
2) Consists of adjustable circuit board
3) Able to perceive environment with sensors built in in hardware and adjust brightness accordingly
4) Have alert sound to user
5) LED blinks in accordance to speed for second

**Working on different light patterns as wave, still, moving and so on for LED
